This repository is created as part of the educational course "PHP MVC From Scratch," which I have completed on Udemy.
The course teaches the creation of web applications from the ground up using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. 
It includes numerous lessons, code examples, and projects to help you gain a better understanding of the following concepts:

- Organizing code using the MVC architecture.
- Working with databases and data models.
- Creating user interfaces using templates (Views).
- Managing business logic using controllers.
